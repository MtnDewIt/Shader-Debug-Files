# TagTool Shader Debug Files

This is an updated version of the existing shader source for TagTool's Shader Generator, as well as some additional modified files for TagTool.

These are designed to assist in the reverse engineering of MS23 / ElDewrito shader data.  

The general idea behind this is to attempt to generate HLSL which can in turn generate shaders that are 1:1 with what exists in MS23 / ElDewrito, or barring that get as close as possible.

All modified shader source files and modified tagtool files have been pulled from thier respective repositories:
